## App Commands (`:` in tree mode)

Tab completes commands. Tab also completes file paths for file commands.

### File Operations

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `:w` | Save current file |
| `:w!` | Force save (overwrite even if changed on disk) |
| `:wa` | Save all files |
| `:q` | Close current file |
| `:qa` / `:q!` | Quit |
| `:e <name>` | New empty file |
| `:o <path>` | Open file (add as top-level tree) |
| `:open <file>` | Open file (auto-detect .md/.json/.todo/.docx) |
| `:resolve` | Resolve file conflicts (when disk changed) |
| `:import <file.md>` | Import markdown under current item |
| `:import <file.docx>` | Import Word document under current item |
| `:export [file.md]` | Export subtree as markdown |
| `:export [file.docx]` | Export subtree as Word document |
| `:export [file.pdf]` | Export subtree as PDF |
| `:write <name>` | Save copy as todo JSON (doesn't switch) |
| `:saveas <name>` | Save as todo JSON and switch to it |

All file commands accept `s3://` paths (e.g. `:open s3://bucket/file.todo.json`).

Legacy Qt ToDo `.todo` XML files are auto-detected and imported by `:open`.

### Tree Operations

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `:collapse` | Collapse children to markdown note |
| `:expand` | Expand markdown note to children |
| `:yank` | Copy subtree as markdown to clipboard |

### Encryption

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `:encrypt` | Encrypt current subtree (prompts password) |
| `:decrypt` | Remove encryption (must unlock first) |
| `→` on 🔒 | Unlock (prompts password) |
| `←` on 🔓 | Lock (re-encrypts, forgets password) |

### Kiro Integration (AI Planning)

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `:kiron` | Mark current node as AI session (kiron) |
| `:kiron disable` | Remove kiron marking (must stop first) |
| `:kiro start [agent]` | Start kiro-cli on current kiron node (with MCP) |
| `:kiro stop` | Stop kiro session |
| `:kiro new` | New session (stop, new session ID, start fresh) |
| `:kiro capture` | Capture kiro response as sibling node |
| `Ctrl+\` / `Opt+\` | Send current node as prompt to kiro |
| `Ctrl+T` | Cycle focus: Tree → Note → Kiro → Tree |
| `Ctrl+R` | Capture kiro response (tree focus, in kiron subtree) |
| `F2` / `Alt+2` | Focus tree (keep right panel as-is) |
| `F3` / `Alt+3` | Focus note panel |
| `F4` / `Alt+4` | Focus kiro panel |
| `PgUp` / `PgDn` | Scroll kiro terminal buffer (in kiro panel) |
| `Tab` | In kiro panel: tab completion (passed to kiro) |
|  | In tree: open note editor (normal behavior) |

Kiron (kiro node; the -on suffix like in electron, proton, neutron) nodes show 🤖 in the tree.
Running kiro shows 🤖▶ on the kiron node.
When inside an active kiron's subtree, the right panel shows
tabs: 📝 Note │ 🤖 Kiro. Active panel has cyan border.

Ctrl+T switches between tree and kiro panel. All typing goes
to kiro when its panel is focused (including Ctrl keys like
Ctrl+C, Ctrl+J). Ctrl+S still saves globally.

Ctrl+\ (or Opt+\ on macOS) sends the current node and its
descendants as markdown to kiro. Use Ctrl+R or `:kiro capture`
to grab the response as a new sibling node marked with 💡.
Sending a new prompt auto-captures any pending previous response.

MCP server starts automatically with `:kiro start`. Kiro can
read and modify the task tree via MCP tools (read_node,
list_children, add_child, mark_done, etc.).

Kiro configuration in `config.toml`:

```toml
[kiro]
command = "kiro-cli"
args = ["chat", "--resume"]
agent = "my-agent"  # optional, default uses built-in "duir" agent
sop = """
After each user request, use add_child to record what you did.
Use the user's request as title and your summary as note.
Mark completed items with mark_done.
"""
```

### Settings

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `:autosave` | Toggle autosave (current file) |
| `:autosave all` | Toggle global autosave |
| `:init` | Create `.duir/` in current directory |
| `:config` | Show effective config |
| `:config write` | Write config to file |
| `:help` | Show this help |
| `:about` | About duir |

## Note Editor (Tab to enter, Tab to return)

### Normal Mode

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `i`/`a`/`I`/`A`/`o`/`O` | Enter insert mode |

| `Tab` | Insert to next tab stop |
| `Backspace` | Delete (back to prev tab stop on leading whitespace) |
| `Enter` | New line with auto-indent |

### Visual Mode

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` | Extend selection |
| `y` | Yank selection (copies to system clipboard) |
| `d`/`x` | Cut selection |

### Editor Commands (`:` in note editor)

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|

| `:set nonu` | Line numbers off |
| `:1,$y` | Yank all lines |

### Count Prefix

Most normal-mode commands accept a count: `3dd`, `5j`, `2yy`, `4w`, `3>`.

All yank/copy/cut operations sync to system clipboard (OSC 52).

## File Conflict Detection

When multiple duir instances share the same files (e.g. central storage),
conflicts are detected automatically:

- **Auto-reload**: If a file changes on disk and you have no local edits, it reloads silently.
- **Conflict warning**: If a file changes on disk while you have unsaved edits, you'll see:
  `⚠ File changed on disk. :w! to force, :e to reload, :resolve for conflicts`

### Resolving Conflicts (`:resolve`)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j`/`k` | Navigate conflicts |
| `m` | Keep mine (local version) |
| `t` | Keep theirs (disk version) |
| `b` | Keep both (duplicates node with "(conflict)" suffix) |
| `Enter` | Apply all resolutions |
| `Esc` | Cancel |

Conflicts are detected per-node by ID. Only nodes that actually differ
(title, note, completion, importance) are shown.

## Config

```
~/.config/duir/config.toml    — global
~/.duirrc                      — user shorthand
.duir/config.toml              — project-local (highest priority)
```

```toml
[storage]
central = "~/.local/share/duir"
local = ".duir"

[editor]
autosave = true
autosave_interval_secs = 30
tab_width = 4
line_numbers = false

[ui]
note_panel_pct = 50
```

## Syntax Highlighting

The note editor highlights markdown and fenced code blocks:

- Headings, bold, italic, inline code, links, checkboxes, blockquotes
- Fenced code blocks with 100+ languages via syntect (base16-ocean.dark theme)
- Cursor preserves syntax colors in normal mode

## Diagrams

Diagram blocks in notes are rendered as images in `.docx` export:

| Block | Tool required |
|-------|---------------|
| ` ```mermaid ` | `mmdc` (mermaid-cli, requires Node.js) |
| ` ```plantuml ` | `plantuml` (requires Java) |
| ` ```dot ` / ` ```graphviz ` | `dot` (graphviz) |

If the tool is not installed, the source text is included as a code block.

Tool paths are configurable:

```toml
[diagrams]
mmdc = "mmdc"
plantuml = "plantuml"
dot = "dot"
```

## S3 Storage

Path format: `s3://bucket/prefix/file`

Tab completion lists buckets and objects.

Supported commands: `:open`, `:import`, `:export`, `:write`, `:saveas`.

Credentials use the standard AWS chain: environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`), `~/.aws/credentials`, or instance role.

Examples:

```
:open s3://my-bucket/todos/work.todo.json
:export s3://my-bucket/reports/sprint.md
:saveas s3://my-bucket/todos/backup.todo.json
```

## Status Colors

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Green | Success (saved, encrypted, unlocked) |
| Yellow | Warning (confirm delete, unlock first) |
| Red | Error (wrong password, save failed) |
| Gray | Info |
